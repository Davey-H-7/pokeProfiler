# Background
The purpose of this app is to allow users to revisit the Pokemon from their favourite games and to check their types and potential stats.

Previously I created a similar application as part of the CodeClan course using React while learning the basics of APIs.
I decided that I could impove upon this and to remake it from scratch for practice but to also use this as an opportunity to gain experience in new technologies.

# Set-Up
Visit the website link: https://main.dq3n8yqlskf40.amplifyapp.com/

or to run locally

- Clone repository onto local machine
- cd into poke_profiler folder (you should see package.json, README.md etc)
- run npm install command
- run npm run dev command to start the app

# Tech Stack
The technology used in this application was selected primarily in order to practice creating applications from scratch and to gain experience in the technologies used, namely:
- Languages: TypeScript, HTML5
- Framework: Next.js
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: AWS Amplify
